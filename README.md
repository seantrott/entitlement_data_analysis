# Entitlement data analysis

This repository contains the critical data and scripts to replicate the analysis in Trott & Rossano (Submitted).

# Details on the data

## Experiment 1

Found in `exp1_critical.csv`.

The main variables of interest are:  
* `condition`: high vs. low entitlement.  
* `request`: raw response produced by participant.  
* `formatting`: annotated formatting (M, EM, D, IS).  
* `reason_final`: final annotation for whether a reason was given.  
* `Just2.ST`: annotation for whether repayment was offered.  

Additionally, the human-normed estimates:  
* `mean_entitlement`  
* `mean_power`  
* `mean_imposition`  
* `mean_distance`  

With random effects:  
* `subject` (participant)  
* `stimNum` (item)  


## Experiment 1b

Found in `exp1b_critical.csv`.

The main variables of interest are:  
* `condition`: high vs. low entitlement.  
* `answer`: raw response produced by participant.  
* `formatting`: annotated formatting (M, EM, D, IS).  
* `Reason2`: final annotation for whether a reason was given.  
* `Repayment2`: annotation for whether repayment was offered.  

Additionally, the human-normed estimates:  
* `mean_entitlement`  
* `mean_power`  
* `mean_imposition`  
* `mean_distance`  

With random effects:  
* `subject` (participant)  
* `stimNum` (item)  


## Experiment 2

Found in `exp2_critical.csv`.

The main variables of interest are:  
* `condition`: high vs. low entitlement.  
* `answer`: response chosen by participant.  
* `formatting`: option chosen (D, M, EM, IS)

Additionally, the human-normed estimates:  
* `mean_entitlement`  
* `mean_power`  
* `mean_imposition`  
* `mean_distance`  

With random effects:  
* `subject` (participant)  
* `stimNum` (item)  


## Experiment 3

Found in `exp3_critical.csv`.

The main variables of interest are:  
* `condition`: high vs. low entitlement.  
* `answer`: response chosen by participant.  
* `formatting`: formatting used by character (D, M, EM, IS)  
* `judgment`: centered answer (from Likert scale)

Additionally, the human-normed estimates:  
* `mean_entitlement`  
* `mean_power`  
* `mean_imposition`  
* `mean_distance`  

With random effects:  
* `subject` (participant)  
* `stimNum` (item)
